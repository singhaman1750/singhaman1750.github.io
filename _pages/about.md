I'm Aman, a PhD student at the Robert Bosch Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems [(RBCCPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/) at IISc Bengaluru, where I work in the [Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com/) under Prof. Shishir N. Y. Kolathaya. My research focuses on enhancing the performance of legged robots through optimal mechanical design.

I earned my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering from IIT Roorkee in 2019 and initially worked as a Formal Verification Engineer at Oski Technology. Driven by my passion for robotics, I joined the Stochastic Robotics Lab in January 2021 and began my doctoral journey in August 2022.

Join me as we explore the thrilling world of walking robots!
