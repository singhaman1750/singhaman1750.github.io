## Hi, I’m Aman Singh

I am a **PhD researcher in Robotics** at the **[IISc, Bengaluru](https://iisc.ac.in/)**, working in the **[Stochastic Robotics Lab](https://www.stochlab.com/)** under the **Centre for Cyber-Physical Systems [(CPS)](https://cps.iisc.ac.in/)**, advised by **[Dr. Shishir N Y Kolathaya](https://www.shishirny.com/)**.

I completed my **B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering** from **[IIT Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/)**, where I developed a strong interest in mechanical design, dynamics, and robotics, which led me toward research-driven hardware development.

My research focuses on **robotic actuator design, planetary gearbox optimization, and hardware-centric co-design for legged robots**. I work on building **practical, reproducible systems**, combining computational optimization, automated CAD, and experimental validation.
