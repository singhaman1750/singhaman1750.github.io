# Personal Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, built with Jekyll and customized from the al-folio theme. It hosts my bio, research interests, publications, projects, news, and blog posts.

## Site Structure (high level)

- Content: `_pages/`, `_posts/`, `_projects/`, `_news/`, `_books/`
- Data: `_data/` (CV, social links, venues, citations, coauthors)
- Publications: `_bibliography/`
- Layouts & components: `_layouts/`, `_includes/`
- Styling & assets: `_sass/`, `assets/`

## Customize Content

- Update site metadata and settings in `_config.yml`.
- Edit pages in `_pages/` and posts in `_posts/`.
- Add or update publications in `_bibliography/papers.bib`.
- Maintain structured data in `_data/` (CV, socials, repositories, venues).

## Build & Preview

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for local setup and build instructions.

## License & Credits

The site is based on the al-folio theme with local modifications. Please check [LICENSE](LICENSE) for licensing details.

#### Theming

A variety of beautiful theme colors have been selected for you to choose from. The default is purple, but you can quickly change it by editing the `--global-theme-color` variable in the `_sass/_themes.scss` file. Other color variables are listed there as well. The stock theme color options available can be found at [\_sass/\_variables.scss](_sass/_variables.scss). You can also add your own colors to this file assigning each a name for ease of use across the template.

#### Social media previews

**al-folio** supports preview images on social media. To enable this functionality you will need to set `serve_og_meta` to `true` in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). Once you have done so, all your site's pages will include Open Graph data in the HTML head element.

You will then need to configure what image to display in your site's social media previews. This can be configured on a per-page basis, by setting the `og_image` page variable. If for an individual page this variable is not set, then the theme will fall back to a site-wide `og_image` variable, configurable in your [\_config.yml](_config.yml). In both the page-specific and site-wide cases, the `og_image` variable needs to hold the URL for the image you wish to display in social media previews.

#### Atom (RSS-like) Feed

It generates an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your posts, useful for Atom and RSS readers. The feed is reachable simply by typing after your homepage `/feed.xml`. E.g. assuming your website mountpoint is the main folder, you can type `yourusername.github.io/feed.xml`

---

#### Related posts

By default, there will be a related posts section on the bottom of the blog posts. These are generated by selecting the `max_related` most recent posts that share at least `min_common_tags` tags with the current post. If you do not want to display related posts on a specific post, simply add `related_posts: false` to the front matter of the post. If you want to disable it for all posts, simply set `enabled` to false in the `related_blog_posts` section in [\_config.yml](_config.yml).

#### Code quality checks

Currently, we run some checks to ensure that the code quality and generated site are good. The checks are done using GitHub Actions and the following tools:

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - check if the formatting of the code follows the style guide
- [lychee](https://lychee.cli.rs/) - check for broken links
- [Axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) (need to run manually) - do some accessibility testing

We decided to keep `Axe` runs manual because fixing the issues are not straightforward and might be hard for people without web development knowledge.

## License

The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio/blob/main/LICENSE).

Originally, **al-folio** was based on the [\*folio theme](https://github.com/bogoli/-folio) (published by [Lia Bogoev](https://liabogoev.com) and under the MIT license). Since then, it got a full re-write of the styles and many additional cool features.
