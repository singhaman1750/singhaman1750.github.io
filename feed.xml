In a planetary gearbox, the module of the sun, the ring and the planet gear should be same in order to get proper meshing of the gears. The mathematical relation of the module, the diameter and the number of teeth of the gear is given as:</p> \[m = \frac{PCD}{N} = \frac{2R}{N}\] <p>where $m$ is the module of a gear, $PCD$ is the Pitch circle diameter of the gear, $R$ is the radius of the gear, and $N$ is the number of teeth of the gear.

Not only does it keep me informed about developments in my field, but it also sparks new ideas and insights. However, when I first embarked on my research journey, I had a misguided notion about how to approach reading research papers. I believed that the best way to read a paper was to start from the beginning and push through to the end in one sitting, hoping to grasp every detail along the way. This approach proved to be highly unproductive and overwhelming.</p> <p>After discussing this challenge with fellow PhD students, one friend pointed me toward a YouTube video featuring Andrew Ng, a renowned expert in machine learning. His practical method for reading research papers was enlightening and has since transformed my approach. Below are the key phases of this method that can help you read research papers more effectively.</p> <h1 id="the-phases-of-reading-a-research-paper">The Phases of Reading a Research Paper</h1> <h2 id="phase-0-initial-assessment">Phase 0: Initial Assessment</h2> <p>In this phase, take a moment to read the <strong>title</strong> and <strong>keywords</strong> associated with the paper. This quick assessment helps you decide whether the paper is relevant to your interests or research area. If the title and keywords pique your curiosity, proceed to read further; if not, feel free to skip it. This step typically takes just <strong>1-2 minutes</strong> but is crucial for filtering out irrelevant papers.</p> <h2 id="phase-1-abstract-and-conclusion">Phase 1: Abstract and Conclusion</h2> <p>Once you’ve decided to read the paper, move on to the abstract and conclusion sections. These parts provide a concise overview of the paper’s motivation, main contributions, and results.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Abstract</strong>: This section summarizes the core ideas and findings of the paper.</li> <li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Here, you’ll find reflections on the results and their implications.</li> <li><strong>Look for Diagrams</strong>: Sometimes one diagram or figure completely encapsulates the key concepts of the paper.</li> </ul> <p>After completing this phase, you should have a general understanding of whether you want to delve deeper into the paper.</p> <h2 id="phase-2-introduction-and-methodology">Phase 2: Introduction and Methodology</h2> <p>In this phase, read the introduction thoroughly while skimming through the methodology section.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Focus on understanding the motivations behind the research, related works, and key contributions.</li> <li><strong>Methodology</strong>: You don’t need to grasp every equation or proof right away; instead, aim to understand the overall approach.</li> </ul> <p>If certain mathematical concepts or algorithms are clear to you at this stage, feel free to engage with them; otherwise, save them for later.</p> <h2 id="phase-3-detailed-examination">Phase 3: Detailed Examination</h2> <p>Now it’s time to dive deeper into the <strong>mathematical details, algorithms, and proofs</strong> presented in the paper. This phase may also involve running any available code associated with the paper if applicable. This detailed examination usually concludes your reading process for most papers. However, if you find yourself particularly intrigued or challenged by certain aspects, you may wish to continue your exploration.</p> <h2 id="phase-4-re-implementation">Phase 4: Re-implementation</h2> <p>In this final phase, consider <strong>re-implementing algorithms</strong> or <strong>working through proofs</strong> independently without referring back to the paper. This exercise can reveal gaps in your understanding or clarify concepts that initially seemed complex.</p> <p>While not all papers will require this level of engagement, it’s especially beneficial for those closely aligned with your own research. For instance, if there’s a proof that could be adapted for your work or an algorithm you aim to improve upon, this phase becomes invaluable.</p> <h2 id="practical-tips-for-effective-reading">Practical Tips for Effective Reading</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Use Phases 0 and 1 Wisely</strong>: These initial phases help you determine if a paper merits your time.</li> <li><strong>Expect Most Papers to End by Phase 2</strong>: In my experience, around 80-90% of papers can be comprehensively understood by this point.</li> <li><strong>Do not spend too much time in related works</strong>: Complete reading this paper first then the other papers it refers to.</li> <li><strong>Reserve Phases 3 and 4 for Relevant Papers</strong>: Focus on these phases when dealing with papers that are particularly pertinent to your current research.</li> <li><strong>Space Out Your Reading</strong>: Don’t feel pressured to complete all phases in one sitting. Consider breaking them up over several days for better retention.</li> </ol> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>I hope this article provides you with a clear framework for reading research papers more effectively. By breaking down your reading into manageable phases, you can enhance your comprehension while minimizing overwhelm.</p> <h2 id="credits--useful-links">Credits &amp; Useful Links</h2> <p>For further reading on effective research practices, consider checking out these resources:</p> <ul> <li>How to read a research paper by <em>Andrew NG</em>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI">Video</a> / <a href="https://github.com/IvLabs/ResearchPaperNotes/tree/master/literature_study_tips">Notes</a></li> <li>How to Read a Paper by <em>S.

Here’s a breakdown of that method.</p> <h1 id="structure-of-the-introduction">Structure of the Introduction</h1> <p>The Introduction should ideally consist of three main parts: Motivation, Related Work, and Contributions.</p> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>In the Motivation section, articulate the reasons behind your research.

Discuss both the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches, highlighting gaps or limitations that your research aims to address. This critical analysis not only situates your work within the broader context but also serves as a foundation for justifying your contributions.</p> <h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2> <p>In the Contributions section, clearly outline what makes your research novel, useful, and significant.

Structure of the Introduction The Introduction should ideally consist of three main parts: Motivation, Related Work, and Contributions. Motivation In the Motivation section, articulate the reasons behind your research. Explain why this field of study is relevant and what specific problem you are addressing. This part should engage readers by highlighting the importance of your research and its potential impact.

Integrating Sections While you can treat these components as separate subsections, it’s often effective to weave them together into a continuous narrative. Each topic can be addressed in separate paragraphs, allowing for a smooth flow of ideas. Writing Tips for Each Section Motivation Narratives: Explore various narratives within your field to create a compelling story. Point Formation: List several key points that emphasize the significance of your research. Editing: After drafting, review for grammatical accuracy and coherence. AI Tools: Utilize AI tools like ChatGPT or Perplexity.ai to help rephrase or refine your paragraphs. Related Work Preparation: Gather previous works relevant to your research area. Advantages and Disadvantages: Create a list detailing both aspects of these papers. Integration: Combine these points into a cohesive subsection. AI Assistance: Again, leverage AI tools to enhance clarity and flow in your writing. Contributions List Format: Clearly delineate each contribution as bullet points. Main Statement: Synthesize these points into a comprehensive main research statement. Rephrasing: Use AI tools to ensure clarity and precision in your contributions. Word Count Considerations The length of the Introduction can vary significantly depending on the type of publication you are targeting.
